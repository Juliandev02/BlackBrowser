# BlackBrowser - A small, but fine browser.

BlackBrowser is a small browser that:
- Has tabs
- can open HTML files
- can save pages
- can print (if no printer is connected, the browser crashes) 
- can go back, and forward
- Can go to the Main Page
- Can reload a page
- where the navigation bar can be moved

and other single Functions ðŸ™‚ 

The whole thing is **still** in the build phase, so everything is relatively unstable.
